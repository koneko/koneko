### Hello there, fellow human being ðŸ‘‹
This is my github profile/portfolio where I upload all of my works.
My best works are here pinned, maybe not the best in terms of tech, but I really loved making them.
I mostly work in javascript, but I am looking to broaden my skills.
#### For more information check out my [website](https://koneko.rocks).

#### Hope you had a good time visiting my profile :3
