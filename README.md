### Hello there, fellow human being 👋
This is my portfolio where I upload and archive all of my works (please don't look at the old ones 😮‍💨).  
My best works are here pinned, maybe not the best in terms of tech, but I really loved making them.  
I mostly work in **Javascript/Typescript** and am learning **C#** in school, but I am always willing to learn more.  
I also do some hobby **System Administrator** work and do all my work on **Linux**.  
My school final work is a [tower defense](https://github.com/koneko/towerdefense) game, which I am developing alone.
